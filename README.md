# totally-not-risk
A better web-based Risk game so we don't have to use Hasbro's...

## problem statement
Our friend group is playing Hasbro's Risk (off of Steam) and we wish we could add a few things:
- faster attacking mechanics
- more maps
- a way to make our own maps
- better music
- less CPU time
- better bots
- more than 6 players in an easy to connect to game
